Hello There,
This is a simple physics engine I am working on
This engine is heavily inspired by Unity Engine's Physics System
I know I cant do everything like them or better than them ( or maybe i can :) )
I am making this because most of us waste a lot of time doing the same thing every project when working with pygame
Anyone can contribute to this project
If This Project gets big enough, I will publish this as a python module
